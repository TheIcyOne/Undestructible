To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand space. The mechanics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the bodies will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also NASA’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into its characterisation- its public funding draws heavily from Steven Hawking literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these orbits, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike space truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in NASA’s existential catchphrase “For the Benefit of All,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Kranz’s American epic Beyond the Moon. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Charles Bolden’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a space tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
